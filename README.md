#Setup:

* Make sure DFGUI is present in your project. (tested on DFGUI 1.0.16 hotfix 1)
* Place the GConsoleDFGUI folder anywhere in your assets folder.
* Put a GConsoleDFGUI prefab in your DFGUI hierarchy (somewhere under the UI Root). 
* You can open example scene, there is a script attached that enables/disables (shows and hides) the UI on button down (tilde by default).
